# Number Guessing Game

## About

In this Python project, I've created a Number Guessing game. Each time, the computer will store a fixed number in the backend, which won't be displayed. The user has to guess the number within 8 chances. If the user guesses the correct number, they'll be given an option to play again or quit.
